\title{Scan a data frame for pattern-matching values (e.g., "*")}
\usage{
star_scan(df, pattern = "*", fixed = TRUE, print = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame to scan.}

\item{pattern}{A character string containing the pattern to match. Default is `"*"`.}

\item{fixed}{Logical. If TRUE (default), `pattern` is treated as a fixed string. If FALSE, it's treated as a regular expression.}

\item{print}{Logical. If TRUE (default), prints a message showing which columns matched.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\describe{
  \item{columns}{A character vector of column names containing matches.}
  \item{summary}{A tibble summarizing how many matches were found per column.}
}
}
\description{
This function scans all columns in a data frame and identifies which columns
contain values matching a given pattern (e.g., `"*"` for suppression). It returns
a list with the names of the columns containing matches and a summary of how many
matches were found in each.
}
\examples{
suppress_cols <- star_scan(chronic24)$columns
