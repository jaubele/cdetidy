get_conflicting_cds(df, cds_col = "cds", org_level_col = "org_level")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing at least two columns: a CDS code and an organization level.}

\item{cds_col}{A string indicating the column name that contains the CDS code. Default is \code{"cds"}.}

\item{org_level_col}{A string indicating the column name that contains the organization level. Default is \code{"org_level"}.}
