\title{Remove dimension-related objects from the global environment}
\usage{
clear_dim_objects(
  base_string = NULL,
  dry_run = TRUE,
  keywords = c("dim", "entit", "group", "label")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{base_string}{A string that all targeted object names should begin with (e.g., `"ltel19"`, `"sbac24"`).}

\item{dry_run}{Logical. If `TRUE`, shows which objects would be removed without actually deleting them. Default is `TRUE`.}

\item{keywords}{A character vector of substrings to match within object names. Defaults to `c("dim", "entit", "group", "label")`.}
}
\value{
(Invisibly) A character vector of object names that matched the filters. If `dry_run = FALSE`, these objects are removed.
}
\description{
Scans the global environment for objects with names that begin with a user-defined `base_string`
and contain keywords like "dim", "entit", "group", or "label". It optionally removes them or
just displays them in a dry run. Useful for cleaning up intermediate or output objects created
during ETL or report generation.
}
\details{
- This function uses pattern matching to find "dimension-like" objects.
- It searches for objects in the global environment (`.GlobalEnv`).
- Useful for scripts that generate many intermediate tables for reporting or dashboarding.
