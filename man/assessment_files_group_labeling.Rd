\title{Apply classification mapping across multiple assessment file columns}
\usage{
assessment_files_group_labeling(df, var_names, output_names)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing one or more columns to classify.}

\item{var_names}{A character vector of column names in `df` to which the classification should be applied.}

\item{output_names}{A character vector of prefixes for new output columns. Must be the same length as `var_names`.}
}
\value{
The original data frame with new columns added for each input variable:
`<prefix>_label`, `<prefix>_num`, `<prefix>_group_num`, and `<prefix>_group`.
}
\description{
This function applies a hardcoded classification map to one or more columns in an assessment dataset.
It dynamically adds new variables for label, numeric code, group number, and group name using
user-defined output prefixes. It also includes interactive prompts to resolve duplicate values that
appear across multiple classifications. Grade values are temporarily recoded to match the map,
then restored after mapping is complete.
}
\details{
- Values in the "grade" column are temporarily recoded to match expected numeric keys in the classification map.
- The function will stop and report any unmatched values.
- Duplicate values across multiple classification entries will prompt the user to choose which label to assign.
}
