\usage{
replace_conflicting_cds(
  df,
  conflicting_cds_df,
  cds_col = "cds",
  org_level_col = "org_level"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the CDS column and org level column to modify.}

\item{conflicting_cds_df}{A data frame containing the list of conflicting CDS codes, typically returned by \code{get_conflicting_cds()}.}

\item{cds_col}{The name of the column that contains the CDS code. Default is \code{"cds"}.}

\item{org_level_col}{The name of the column that contains the org level. Default is \code{"org_level"}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with updated CDS values. Adds a temporary \code{altered_cds} column that marks modified rows with \code{1}.
}
\description{
Detects CDS codes that appear at multiple organization levels and appends \code{"9999"} to the
\code{cds} code for school-level (\code{"S"}) records, allowing the dataset to preserve uniqueness.
This is typically used to resolve ambiguity in CDE datasets before loading into a warehouse.
