\title{Resolve conflicting CDS codes by appending a suffix to school-level entries}
\usage{
replace_conflicting_cds(
  df,
  conflicting_cds_df,
  cds_col = "cds",
  org_level_col = "org_level"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the CDS column and org level column to modify.}

\item{conflicting_cds_df}{A data frame containing the list of conflicting CDS codes, typically returned by `get_conflicting_cds()`.}

\item{cds_col}{The name of the column that contains the CDS code. Default is `"cds"`.}

\item{org_level_col}{The name of the column that contains the org level. Default is `"org_level"`.}
}
\value{
A data frame with updated CDS values. Adds a temporary `altered_cds` column that marks modified rows with `1`.
}
\description{
Detects CDS codes that appear at multiple organization levels and appends `"9999"` to the
`cds` code for school-level (`"S"`) records, allowing the dataset to preserve uniqueness.
This is typically used to resolve ambiguity in CDE datasets before loading into a warehouse.
