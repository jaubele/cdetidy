}
\arguments{
\item{df1}{The first data frame to compare.}

\item{df2}{The second data frame to compare.}
}

along with the specific variables that are present in one but not the other. This function is useful
for checking schema consistency across datasets, especially in ETL or QA workflows.

\examples{
df1 <- data.frame(a = 1, b = 2)
df2 <- data.frame(a = 1, c = 3)
compare_variable_names(df1, df2)
