\title{Split SBAC test data into ELA and Math datasets}
\usage{
split_sbac_test(data, base_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing a `"test"` column with values `1` (ELA) and `2` (Math).}

\item{base_name}{A base string used to generate object names. Resulting objects will be named
`<base_name>_ela` and `<base_name>_math`.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list with two components:
- `ela`: The subset of rows with `test == 1`
- `math`: The subset of rows with `test == 2`
}
\description{
Splits a dataset with a `"test"` column (coded as 1 = ELA, 2 = Math) into two separate data frames.
Assigns the resulting datasets to the global environment using names based on a user-defined base name.
}
\details{
- Rows with `test == 1` are assumed to be ELA records; `test == 2` are assumed to be Math.
- Warnings are printed if unexpected values are present in either subset.
- Resulting datasets are assigned to the global environment with descriptive names.
- Use `invisible()` to suppress printing if calling programmatically.

\dontrun{
split_sbac_test(sbac_data, base_name = "sbac23")
# Creates sbac23_ela and sbac23_math in your environment
}
