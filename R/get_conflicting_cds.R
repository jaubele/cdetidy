#' Identify CDS codes linked to multiple organization levels
#'
#' Flags CDS codes that are associated with more than one organization level (e.g., school, district, county)
#' within the same dataset â€” a common data integrity issue when merging or aggregating across org levels.
#'
#' @param df A data frame containing at least two columns: a CDS code and an organization level.
#' @param cds_col A string indicating the column name that contains the CDS code. Default is `"cds"`.
#' @param org_level_col A string indicating the column name that contains the organization level. Default is `"org_level"`.
#'
#' @return A data frame with one row per conflicting CDS code and a column `unique_org_levels`
#' indicating how many org levels were found for each code.
#'
#' @export
